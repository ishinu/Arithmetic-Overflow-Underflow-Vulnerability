# Arithmetic Overflow Vulnerability ( ~ Works till solidity v0.6.12 only ) 

Here is a 'Old' vulnerability of Solidity, Unlike other programming languages, solidity wasn't throwing any error for this particular 
scenario.

`Working as an Odometer.`

If you wonder what happens when we exceed to largest number in an odometer...

Yes. It starts all the way back from 0. Similarly the case what if in an odometer toy, we reverse from 0 which takes us to the largest number.

`Till v0.6.12 only! Afterwards Solidity did a GREAT job fixing it!` 

- In this project we are using specifically v0.6.12 just to demonstrate the vulnerability.

Unlike other blockchain project repositories, this will be using Typescript for running tests and deploying to Ropsten public testnet, as soon it's done testing, README will be updated with proper guide for you.
